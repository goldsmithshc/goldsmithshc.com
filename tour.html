    <h2>Festival Central & HQ</h2>
    From the tournament organisers:
    <q>Our aim is to keep everyone together (when not playing) over the weekend during the day, so we will be centred around the Sports Arena where there will also be food retailers and hockey shops. 

Please note that Al Fresco will be in the same place as last year, up the bank and through the gate to the cricket club which is a 2 minute walk. They will have their usual excellent range of food with lots of choice. 

There will also be a small Marquee for shelter with its own seating and music. The Grandstand also has cover and seating, but if you wish to watch the hockey on the astro feel free to bring your own ‘Festival’ style fold up chairs but please do not sit behind the goals. </q>
    
    <h2>Social events</h2>
    From the tournament organisers:
    <q>The full line up of the weekend’s social events and club nights are now online.

The Friday evening team shirt social event will take place in Barvaria (Club Domain) on the Promenade. It is “Happy Hour” from 22:00 - 23:00 so make sure you are there nice and early to take advantage.

If you are staying on or close to Reads Avenue join us and several other teams from 19:30 for pre drinks at The New Sandringham Court Hotel (65-69 Reads Avenue FY14DG). This is followed by the Glow Party and band Venezuala Venezuala upstairs at Walkabout Queens Street from 22:00.

Sunday Fancy dress at Domain as always. please try and get there before 22:00 ready for the fancy dress dance off. Don’t forget to register your team for the competition at the DJ booth. 

Please make every effort to attend along with your team mates at ALL our organised social events each evening to support our partners. 
</q>

    <h2>Finally</h2>
    From the tournament organisers:
    <q>PLEASE REMEMBER ABSOLUTELY NO NUDITY, INAPPROPRIATE FANCY DRESS COSTUMES OR TEAM THEMES. DO NOT FORGET WE HOLD EVENTS IN AREAS WHERE PARTICIPANTS COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NEGATIVE PRESS OR POLICE INVOLVEMENT IS A MASSIVE RISK TO THE FUTURE OF THE FESTIVAL.</q>

    <q>PLEASE RESPECT THOSE AROUND US. ANY ISSUES BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION WILL BE DEALT WITH BY THE COMMITTEE.</q>
